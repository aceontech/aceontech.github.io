It’s a little known fact (at least, it was to me) that you can actually use your computer’s keyboard when interacting with the Windows Phone 7 & 8 emulators. This feature is somewhat hidden and differs slightly between the major OS versions:

* Windows Phone 8: Page-Down enables computer keyboard, Page-Up disables it
* Windows Phone 7: Page-Up enables computer keyboard, Page-Down disables it

Funny how this is inconsistent between versions. In any case, it eliminates the need for clumsily clicking keys on the on-screen keyboard.
